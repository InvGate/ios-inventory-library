Welcome to the release version 1.0 of Flyve MDM Inventory Library for iOS!

We are proud to introduce you the Inventory Library for iOS which helps you to create a complete inventory of your iOS devices where both hardware and software information are collected. You get the data about hardware, memory, drives, and [more](#the-specifications), in a beautiful XML as protocol compatible with Fusion Inventory for GLPI. 

Here you will find the most important characteristics of the Inventory Library.

### Brand new library

We created the library from the Fusion Inventory Agent following the [inventory protocol](http://fusioninventory.org/documentation/dev/spec/protocol/inventory.html "More information of Fusion Inventory") adding new specifications in order to offer an improved performance to our users.

### Easy Implementation

We designed the library with an easy implementation in order to facilitate its use in your code, as you can see in the following example:

```
import FlyveMDMInventory

let inventoryTask = InventoryTask()
inventoryTask.execute("Agent_v1.0", tag:"1.0") { result in
    print(result)
}
```
It requires iOS 9.3 or higher.

### Continuos Integration

The development of this library was made with the latest technologies in continuos integration, we included Circle CI to our project in order to verify that the changes and new functionalities of the code do not affect the status of the software, maintaining a quality control.
